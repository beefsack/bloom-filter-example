# Bloom filters

# First, what is a hash set?

To understand Bloom filters, it helps to understand simple hash sets.

* Hash sets are often just bit arrays (can be thought of as an array of
  booleans)
* Values are inserted using hash of input

A shitty example of a hash function just uses modulus:

```rust
input % 10
```

Inserting the values `13`, `27` and `57` into a hash set using that hash
function might look like:

<table border="1" style="margin: auto;">
  <tr>
    <th>Hash</th>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>9</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Value</th>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td style="color: red;">1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td style="color: red;">1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <caption></caption>
</table>

There's a collision above, and most hash set implementations have collision
handling built in, usually just using equality and some form of fallback
storage.

# Then, what is a Bloom filter?

A Bloom filter is a special type of hash set which sacrifices accuracy for time
and space efficiency.

Generally, Bloom filters are used when you can't fit a hash set into memory.

Bloom filters are of **fixed size** determined by the developer, and **use
multiple hash functions** instead of just one.

---

# Wait, multiple hash functions?

When inserting or reading values in a Bloom filter, multiple hash functions are
used independently, and multiple offsets in the storage are accessed.

The reason for this is shown later on, for now lets just see how that works.

Our shitty contrived hash functions just use modulus (`3`, `5` and `7`.)

```rust
hash_a = input % 3
hash_b = input % 5
hash_c = input % 10
```

For an example input of `12`, the hashes `0`, `2` and `2` are produced, and
inserting this into the Bloom filter results in:

<table border="1" style="margin: auto;">
  <tr>
    <th>Hash</th>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>9</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Value</th>
    <td style="color: red">1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td style="color: red">1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <caption></caption>
</table>

And when reading values from the Bloom filter, all hashes are read and the
result is `true` iff all hashes in the Bloom filter are `1`.

But what if we try to lookup `42`?

# Implications of a Bloom filter

There are some important things to note about the fixed nature of Bloom filters:

* False positives become more common as the Bloom filter fills up
* Collisions are never explicitly handled for efficiency reasons

**Therefore we can only be certain if a value has never been inserted into a
Bloom filter.**

Just because all hashes for a value in a Bloom filter are `1`, it is possible
that happened due to collisions.

# Effect of number of hash functions

The number of hash functions used changes the rate of false positives over time.

The following chart was generated from [some toy code](https://github.com/beefsack/Bloom-filter-example/blob/master/src/main.rs).

# So, why use a Bloom filter?

An example is Akamai (one of the oldest and largest CDNs in the world)
[use Bloom filters to choose what to cache](https://www.akamai.com/jp/ja/multimedia/documents/technical-publication/algorithmic-nuggets-in-content-delivery-technical-publication.pdf)

* A common enemy of cache size efficiency are "one-hit-wonders": values which
  are cached once but never accessed again
* Before caching content, Akamai check whether the content has been accessed
  once previously using a Bloom filter, and only cache if it is the second time
  content is accessed
* It would be impossible to store the amount of values they require in a set,
  so a Bloom filter is a viable option, using mere megabytes of memory instead
  of potentially requiring terabytes
* **After using a Bloom filter, Akamai reduced their storage requirements by
  75%**

I hope someone got a pay rise after that.

# Other uses

* A number of database engines use Bloom filters to avoid disk lookup for
  non-existent rows and columns.
* Chrome use a Bloom filter for quick local identification of potentially
  malicious websites. If the local Bloom filter returns `true`, the site is then
  checked by Google.
* Medium uses Bloom filters to avoid recommending articles a user has already
  read.

# Summary

Bloom filters can be a very cool way to avoid expensive processes or are a very
efficient way to use sets where accuracy isn't paramount and space is a concern!
